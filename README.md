Labelled data describing software modules with 9 software process attributes, one of which includes the total number of faults per module, is analyzed and prepared for WEKA modelling by converting to the ARFF file format. The training data (fit.dat), containing 188 instances is used to train both predictive and classification models using WEKA. The test data's 94 instances (test.dat) is then used to evaluate the models and compare results.
